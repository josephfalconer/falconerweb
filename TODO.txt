- Sort out primary region/sub region relationship in backend.
  Primary regions should have some sort of model method which gets the required data for each sub region.
  On the front end should only have to iterate without matching sub regions to primary regions.
  Backend methods could also asign x/y values to sub regions.

- Sort out rendering of routes - sub routes shouldn't be wrapped under the render components of primary routes.
  Current strategy renders sub routes unreachable when not currently visiting the related primary route.

- Don't have separate branches production/master. Consider having different settings outside of VC.

- Switch redirect for <IndexRoute render={<IncomingRegion data={primaryRegions[0]}} /> } />
