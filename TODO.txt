- Find a way to make /start/ show at root url, or add a welcome component (maybe with animated curly brackets/highlight controls etc) - fix this with url exact ('/') and maybe have a is_homepage flag on parentZone model?

- Investigate using BrowserRouter with Django (pass browserHistory to router, fix 404 etc).

- Instead of get by id, const node = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);

- pull in skills, demos

- if child zone is first to render needs to put its siblings into store

- clean up migrations/add test back up there

- write a proper action creator for api calls

- why doesnt nav have background on white page
