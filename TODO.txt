- Sort out primary region/sub region relationship in backend.
  Primary regions should have some sort of model method which gets the required data for each sub region.
  On the front end should only have to iterate without matching sub regions to primary regions.
  Backend methods could also asign x/y values to sub regions.

- Don't have separate branches production/master. Consider having different settings outside of VC.

- Find a way to make /start/ show at root url, or add a welcome component (maybe with animated curly brackets/highlight controls etc)

- Refactor dispatch actions/reducers

- Tidy up code style/any other refactoring

- Investigate using BrowserRouter with Django (pass browserHistory to router, fix 404 etc).
