- Don't have separate branches production/master. Consider having different settings outside of VC.

- Find a way to make /start/ show at root url, or add a welcome component (maybe with animated curly brackets/highlight controls etc)

- Investigate using BrowserRouter with Django (pass browserHistory to router, fix 404 etc).

- Investigate the effect of using Route render prop for IncomingRegion: any side effects on performance or anything? Is it better to just give Route a child -> IncomingRegion?

- Instead of get by id, const node = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);

- work out if withRouter is needed in all the places I've used it

- pull in nav items, skills, demos

- if child zone is first to render needs to put its siblings into store
