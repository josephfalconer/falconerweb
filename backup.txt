TITLE: JavaScript
TEXT: A rapidly evolving technology, JavaScript remains a primary interest area for me. When it comes to building UIs I am most intrigued by the functionality (although I also appreciate aesthetics).<br>
<br>
It's an exciting time for JavaScript - not least because of ES6 and its syntax improvements. <a href="https://www.contentful.com/blog/2017/04/04/es6-modules-support-lands-in-browsers-is-it-time-to-rethink-bundling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefan Judis</a> has some interesting thoughts about the future of ES6 in browsers. For now we continue to transpile 'future' code into universally supported code. <br>
<br>
Working with JavaScript frameworks and libraries like ReactJS and AngularJS has inspired me to write better 'vanilla' code. In my current role we developed a set of common UI components without any library dependencies, not even jQuery. I use Webpack for bundling, working modular whether I'm using React, jQuery or plain JavaScript.<br>
<br>
I enjoy working with ReactJS and used the library along with React Router and Redux to build the data-driven application you're now visiting. In September 2016 I facilitated a short workshop on React Router at Codebar's <a href="https://medium.com/the-codelog/uncodebar-3-3d879ecd2d7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncodebar 3</a> 'unconference' event.<br>
<br>
Check out <a href="/#/experiments/play-demos">experiments</a> to see some of the more playful things I have done with JavaScript.

TITLE: UI styling
TEXT: A web developer's career cannot begin before embracing the American spelling of 'colour'. Well, when working with CSS at least.<br>
<br>
Originally coming to the industry with the ambition to become a 'front-end' developer, I focussed on a three-part skill set: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although experience has given me most satisfaction in JavaScript and programming, I considered these areas to be equally important, and have continued to work closely with styling.<br>
<br>
Sass affords us many conveniences of programming-inspired syntax, but CSS has its own unique behaviours. For example, from a purely JavaScript point of view, you could shun stylesheets altogether and inline all styles with React components, as some programmers do. I stick with external cascading style sheets - let's not forget how specificity and the cascade work.<br>
<br>
Static assets aside, if you're working with dynamically computed styles it can be very useful to apply them via React's 'style' attribute.

TITLE: Server-side integration
TEXT: My current role involves working within a small team, undertaking a broad variety of tasks. A large part of the work is setting up CMS systems for content editors. This involves channeling a level of control over page structure and appearance we afford to clients.<br>
<br>
I mostly use PHP to build flexible template systems on the back end. These templates take data from the CMS and display content according to mockups from designers. I also use Python/Django which has its own beautiful template system.

TITLE: Python
TEXT: The Python programming language remains one of my favourite technologies due to its power and easy-on-the-eye (and mind) syntax. I recently started attending Brighton Python User Group and hope to have more involvement with Python in the future.<br>
<br>
I first came across Python in a previous role working on a learning platform built on Django. I continue to use this framework for my personal projects (the app you're visiting now has a Django API) and will always enjoy working with it.

<h3>Interests</h3>
I love learning other languages, including Japanese and Spanish. Before working with technology I was an English teacher abroad, first in in South Korea and later in Spain. I am fascinated by other cultures and times and love to read, travel and imagine. Before teaching my background was Fine Art. I have recently found time to pick up my pencils and brushes again which is a real pleasure. I am also learning some basic piano skills.

<h3>INTO University Partnerships</h3>
I worked within an in-house team to deliver a digital learning platform used by thousands of INTO students. I helped to develop the restyle maintaining the company brand and offering an enjoyable user experience. This brought me into professional contact with Django, PHP, ReactJS, CSS and Sass, IDEs PyCharm and PHPStorm, Gulp and Webpack amongst other things.<br>
<br>
<h3>Agency Work</h3>
I currently work in a fast-paced agency environment where we negotiate multiple client accounts within tight time scales. We have improved our workflow through the development of small starter frameworks, saving time spent on common tasks.  I work flexibly on both server-side and client-side tasks producing high-performance websites for a variety of clients.
